  status: Hi 👋, I'm Jorge Niedbalski.
  description: |
    I’m an engineer with a focus on Open Source and Linux.

    Over the years, I’ve specialised in performance engineering and systems observability, building
    and using tools that help uncover bottlenecks, performance issues and security problems.

    I am also an active core developer of [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io), where I work on nice features and help clean up the backlog.

    I do consulting and take on hands on roles when an interesting challenge comes up. These days, 
    I help [Garnet](https://garnet.ai) build a runtime security platform that detects threats efficiently and in a vendor-agnostic way using [eBPF](https://jibril.garnet.ai/).

    Previously, I’ve worked on multiple startups, including Chronosphere (acquired by Palo Alto Networks),
    Calyptia (acquired by Chronosphere), Nimbic (acquired by Siemens), and Betazeta (acquired by
    Metro International).

    Earlier in my career, I worked at [Canonical](https://canonical.com), where I spent a lot of time debugging Linux systems
    and contributing to the Debian/Ubuntu ecosystem. I also led the cloud-on-ARM64 initiative at
    [Linaro](https://linaro.org), helping make OpenStack and Kubernetes run on the first generation of ARM server
    architectures.
