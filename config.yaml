    I'm a systems engineer with a passion for all things open source and Linux.
  
    These days, I'm a technical lead for [Calyptia Inc](https://calyptia.com)'s Backend team, mixing C, Golang, 
    and cloud native tech to build an observability platform on top of [Fluentbit](https://fluentbit.io).
  
    Before this, I was a Senior Software Engineer at [Canonical](https://canonical.com), 
    knee-deep in debugging Linux systems, and even worked with [Linaro](https://linaro.org)'s team, driving their cloud on arm64 initiative.
    
    My [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niedbalskir/)'s open! I'm always open to connecting with fellow professionals and discussing exciting opportunities.
