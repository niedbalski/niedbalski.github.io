    I'm a systems engineer and open source advocate with expertise in developing, testing, and automating 
    Linux-based infrastructure.
    
    My current role is as a technical lead for the Backend team at [Calyptia Inc](https://calyptia.com), 
    where we're building an observability platform on top of [Fluentbit](https://fluentbit.io) using C, Golang, 
    and cloud native technologies.
  
    Prior to my current position, I had the opportunity to work as a Senior Software Engineer at [Canonical](https://canonical.com), 
    where I gained a lot of experience debugging and throubleshooting Linux systems. Before that, 
    I was part of the [Linaro](https://linaro.org) team, where I had the exciting responsibility of driving the [cloud 
    on arm64](https://linaro.cloud) initiative.
    
    If you're interested in learning more about my professional background, 
    please feel free to check out my [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/jniedbalski) profile. 
    I'm always open to connecting with fellow professionals and discussing exciting opportunities.
